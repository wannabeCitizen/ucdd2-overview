                    <h2 style="text-align: left">Primary Concepts:</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Client = The browser rendering/receiving the page</li>
                        <li>Server = The computer hosting the website and data</li>
                        <li>HTTP Protocol = How messages are sent between different agents (i.e., clients and servers) on the web</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h2 style="text-align: left">HTTP Protocol</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Communication protocol (most common HTTP 1.1, but HTTP 2.0 is being hacked on now)</li>
                        <li>Uses headers to provide metadata about the request (e.g, what IP it's for, user-agent, origin-domain, data types, etc)</li>
                        <li>Uses a body to provide data or DOM content</li>
                        <li>Clients and Servers are pre-programmed to do a lot of things that prevent hacking (probably why you banged your head a bunch)</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h2 style="text-align: left">Client</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Renders a DOM (Document object model), which is essentially a tree where each vertex corresponds to something rendered on the page</li>
                        <li>DOM gets build as HTML with CSS marking it up (ie., styling it)</li>
                        <li>Browsers have compilers (most use V8) and run single-threaded, asynchronous processes that run the compiled JavaScript and consume the DOM (i.e., read the DOM, do computations, update the DOM)</li>
                        <li>Client's use the IP address of the computer running them</li>
                </ul>

                    <h2 style="text-align: left">Server</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Accepts requests through a port that is being listened to by a webserver (for websites, port 80)</li>
                        <li>Requests have their headers considered then their body, and the webserver then decides how to respond given this information (APIs often respond with raw data, but websites with a DOM)</li>
                        <li>Web servers mediate the relationship between the client, any database, and a set of files that represent the different pages on the website</li>
                    </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li>Front-end JS expects a DOM (i.e., document) to consume, this was originally added to the web (ECMAScript) in order to allow the web to be dynamic</li>
                    <li>Server-side JS began with Node where the V8 compiler was written into an interpreter than runs on File Systems (not DOMs!)</li>
                    <li>Databases (No-SQL) have begun adopting the JS Object (ie, {key: value} ) as a means of storage also</li>

                   <ul>
                       <li>Node = JavaScript running on a file system</li>
                       <li>NPM = Online library of downloadable packages, making it easy to add them to an application you're building</li>
                       <li>It's common to use dependency managers (eg, Bower or RequireJS) and build systems (eg, gulp, wintersmith, or grunt) so that you can write your application's logic in separate modules without worrying about scope and dependencies, but then you run your build script to create your real website</li>

                    <h2 style="text-align: left">Express</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Most common web server used for Node</li>
                        <li>Gives you all the tools you need to listen to a port, handle a request, and generate a response</li>
                        <li>Will not, by default, merely expose all files (security issue!), thus you must define what files are exposed, whether a database exists, and what URLs anticipated</li>
                        <li>Also can help you do sessioning and authentication; though you'll often use some other tools together with Express</li>

                    <h2 style="text-align: left">Jade and Wintersmith</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Jade is nothing more than shorthand HTML.  It also helps in modularizing your file since we commonly use the same headers, footers, and navbars across views</li>
                        <li>BUT! Jade is NOT HTML, and thus it requires a build engine to be converted</li>
                        <li>Wintersmith is a build engine for making static websites, thus it is often used with Jade</li>
                        <li>Wintersmith provides in separating out static views, modules, plugins, etc so you can patch them together into a static page when building</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>This is a testing framework for JavaScript</li>
                        <li>Often used in tandem with a build engine so you can set a task that runs all your functionality tests before building</li>
                        <li>Another testing framework is Jasmine, and almost anyone you talk to will use one of these two.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>No-SQL Database = instead of table with rows and columns, we have documents of keys and values</li>
                        <li>Need to establish a connection as Mongo is read from a socket (cf. TCP/IP protocol to understand sockets)</li>
                        <li>Uses a JavaScript-like syntax for querying, making it very convenient for Node applications</li>
                        <li>There are many libraries (eg, Mongoose) that can help you handle your Mongo CRUD operations cleanly</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>JQuery is a library with common utilities to help manipulate the DOM with JavaScript</li>
                        <li>LoDash or Underscore provides common operations used working with data (ie, the model)</li>
                        <li>For Client, load these in a script tag, then any subsequent JS can expect these function in scope</li>
                        <li>For Server, must require them as a module then can use their functionality</li>
                        <li>Be Careful!  Always read source.  For instance, JQuery's .get() function caused many people headaches because it sets headers in an assumptive manner</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>MVC = Model, View, Controller -- it is a common approach for thinking about web applications.</li>
                        <li>Model = The data that is relevant to a particular state of a web application</li>
                        <li>View = A particular rendering of data and web components.  This can be controlled through static paths (URLs) or with a dynamic framework like React or Angular</li>
                        <li>Controller = The logical backbone of your application that works to ensure the model is transformed appropriately, events are triggered on time, and server-client communications are done correctly.</li>

                <section>
                    <h2 style="text-align: left">React JS and other frameworks</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Each of these "web frameworks" provides a way of thinking about MVC/Web App Design.</li>
                        <li>React is meant to help your separate out components of your web page that have distinct logic, often controlled by "events" or "streams"</li>
                        <li>Thinking in "React" is mostly deciding what parts of your view need what data then determining hierarchies of components that chan share data.</li>
                        <li>React is mostly a library that helps you give your view components logic about how they render and change.</li>
